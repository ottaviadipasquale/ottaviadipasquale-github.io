									<p>Chronic pain is a world-wide clinical challenge. Response to analgesic treatment is limited and difficult to predict. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been suggested as a potential solution. However, while most analgesics target specific neurotransmission pathways, fMRI-based biomarkers are not specific for any neurotransmitter system, limiting our understanding of how they might contribute to predict treatment response.<br />

										Here, we sought to bridge this gap by applying Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) to investigate whether neurotransmission-enriched functional connectivity (FC) mapping can provide insights into the brain mechanisms underlying chronic pain and inter-individual differences in analgesic response after a placebo or duloxetine. Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain patients (n=56) underwent pre-treatment brain scans in two clinical trials. Study 1 (n=17) was a 2-week single-blinded placebo pill trial. Study 2 (n=39) was a 3-month double-blinded randomized trial comparing placebo to duloxetine, a dual serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.<br />

										Across two independent studies, we found that chronic pain OA patients present FC alterations in the FC related to the serotonin (SERT) and noradrenaline (NET) transporters, when compared to age-matched healthy controls. Placebo responders presented with higher pre-treatment dopamine transporter (DAT)-enriched FC than non-responders. Duloxetine responders presented with higher pre-treatment SERT and NET-enriched FC than non-responders. Pre-treatment SERT and NET-enriched FC achieved predictive positive values of duloxetine response up to 85.71%.<br />

										Neurotransmission-enriched FC mapping might hold promise as a new mechanistic-informed biomarker for functional brain alterations and prediction of response to pharmacological analgesia in chronic pain.<br />

										<p>The study of complex systems deals with emergent behavior that arises as a result of nonlinear spatiotemporal interactions between a large number of components both within the system, as well as between the system and its environment. There is a strong case to be made that neural systems as well as their emergent behavior and disorders can be studied within the framework of complexity science. In particular, the field of neuroimaging has begun to apply both theoretical and experimental procedures originating in complexity science—usually in parallel with traditional methodologies. Here, we illustrate the basic properties that characterize complex systems and evaluate how they relate to what we have learned about brain structure and function from neuroimaging experiments. We then argue in favor of adopting a complex systems-based methodology in the study of neuroimaging, alongside appropriate experimental paradigms, and with minimal influences from noncomplex system approaches. Our exposition includes a review of the fundamental mathematical concepts, combined with practical examples and a compilation of results from the literature.</p>

											<p>Oxytocin has recently received remarkable attention for its role as a modulator of human behaviour. Here, we aimed to expand our knowledge of the neural circuits engaged by oxytocin by investigating the effects of intranasal and intravenous oxytocin on the functional connectome at rest in 16 healthy men. Oxytocin modulates the functional connectome within discrete neural systems, but does not affect the global capacity for information transfer. These local effects encompass key hubs of the oxytocin system (e.g. amygdala) but also regions overlooked in previous hypothesis-driven research (i.e. the visual circuits, temporal lobe and cerebellum). Increases in levels of oxytocin in systemic circulation induce broad effects on the functional connectome, yet we provide indirect evidence supporting the involvement of nose-to-brain pathways in at least some of the observed changes after intranasal oxytocin. Together, our results suggest that oxytocin effects on human behaviour entail modulation of multiple levels of brain processing distributed across different systems.<br />

												<p>The potential of intranasal oxytocin to treat several brain disorders is hampered by questions regarding the most effective dose to engage central targets and the validity of haemodynamic neuroimaging to capture its effects on neuronal activity. Using a dose-response design (9, 18 and 36 IU), we demonstrate that resting oxytocin-induced physiological changes in the amygdala, a key-hub of the brain oxytocin system, are consistent with an inverted-U dose-response curve, with maximal effects for lower doses. Yet, the effects of oxytocin vary by amygdala subdivision, highlighting the need to qualify dose-response curves within region. We further link physiological changes with the density of the oxytocin receptor gene mRNA across brain regions, strengthening our confidence in intranasal oxytocin as a valid approach to target central targets. We also demonstrate that intranasal oxytocin does not disrupt cerebrovascular reactivity, corroborating the validity of haemodynamic neuroimaging to probe its effects on the human brain.</p>

													<p>How pain‐related resting state networks are affected by tonic cold‐pain remains unknown. We investigated functional connectivity alterations during and following tonic cold pain in healthy volunteers. Cold pain perturbed the functional connectivity of the ventro‐medial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and the periacquaductal grey area. These connectivity changes were associated with the magnitude of individuals’ reported pain. We suggest that some connectivity changes described in chronic pain patients may be due to an ongoing afferent peripheral drive.</p>

														<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be combined with drugs to investigate the system-level functional responses in the brain to such challenges. However, most psychoactive agents act on multiple neurotransmitters, limiting the ability of fMRI to identify functional effects related to actions on discrete pharmacological targets. We recently introduced a multimodal approach, REACT (Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets), which offers the opportunity to disentangle effects of drugs on different neurotransmitters and clarify the biological mechanisms driving clinical efficacy and side effects of a compound. Here, we focus on methylphenidate (MPH), which binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), to unravel its effects on dopaminergic and noradrenergic functional circuits in the healthy brain at rest. We then explored the relationship between these target-enriched resting state functional connectivity (FC) maps and inter-individual variability in behavioural responses to a reinforcement-learning task encompassing a novelty manipulation to disentangle the molecular systems underlying specific cognitive/behavioural effects. Our main analysis showed a significant MPH-induced FC increase in sensorimotor areas in the functional circuit associated with DAT. In our exploratory analysis, we found that MPH-induced regional variations in the DAT and NET-enriched FC maps were significantly correlated with some of the inter-individual differences on key behavioural responses associated with the reinforcement-learning task. Our findings show that main MPH-related FC changes at rest can be understood through the distribution of DAT in the brain. Furthermore, they suggest that when compounds have mixed pharmacological profiles, REACT may be able to capture regional functional effects that are underpinned by the same cognitive mechanism but are related to engagement of distinct molecular targets.</p>

												<h4>Linking pain sensation to the autonomic nervous system: the role of the anterior cingulate and periaqueductal gray resting-state networks.</h4>

															<p>There are bi-directional interactions between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain. This is likely underpinned by a substantial overlap between brain areas of the central autonomic network and areas involved in pain processing and modulation. To date, however, relatively little is known about the neuronal substrates of the ANS-pain association. Here, we acquired resting state fMRI scans in 21 healthy subjects at rest and during tonic noxious cold stimulation. As indicators of autonomic function, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) frequency measures were influenced by tonic noxious stimulation and how these variables related to participants’ pain perception and to brain functional connectivity in regions known to play a role in both ANS regulation and pain perception, namely the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Our findings support a role of the cardiac ANS in brain connectivity during pain, linking functional connections of the dACC and PAG with measurements of low frequency (LF)-HRV. In particular, we identified a three-way relationship between the ANS, cortical brain networks known to underpin pain processing, and participants’ subjectively reported pain experiences. LF-HRV both at rest and during pain correlated with functional connectivity between the seed regions and other cortical areas including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left anterior insula (AI), and the precuneus. Our findings link cardiovascular autonomic parameters to brain activity changes involved in the elaboration of nociceptive information, thus beginning to elucidate underlying brain mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relationship between autonomic and pain-related systems.</p>

													<h4>The association between pain-induced autonomic reactivity and descending pain control is mediated by the periaqueductal grey.</h4>

																<p>There is a strict interaction between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain, which might involve descending pain modulatory mechanisms. The periaqueductal grey (PAG) is involved both in descending pain modulation and ANS, but its role in mediating this relationship has not yet been explored.<br />
																	Here, we sought to determine brain regions mediating ANS and descending pain control associations. 30 participants underwent Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) assessments, in which they rated painful pressure stimuli applied to their thumbnail, either alone or with a painful cold contralateral stimulation. Differences in pain ratings between ‘pressure-only’ and ‘pressure+cold’ stimuli provided a measure of descending pain control. In 18 of the 30 participants, structural scans and two functional MRI assessments, one pain-free and one during cold-pain, were acquired. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) was simultaneously recorded.<br />
																	Low frequency HRV (LF-HRV) and the CPM score were negatively correlated; individuals with higher LF-HRV during pain reported reductions in pain during CPM. PAG-frontal medial cortex (FMC) and PAG-rostral ventro-medial medulla (RVM) functional connectivity correlated negatively with the CPM. Importantly, PAG-FMC functional connectivity mediated the strength of HRV-CPM association. CPM response magnitude was also negatively associated with PAG and positively associated with FMC grey matter volumes.<br />
																Our multi-modal approach, using behavioral, physiological and MRI measures, provides important new evidence of interactions between ANS and descending pain mechanisms. ANS dysregulation and dysfunctional descending pain modulation are characteristics of chronic pain. We suggest that further investigation of body-brain interactions in chronic pain patients may catalyse the development of new treatments.</p>

																	<p>The investigation of brain functional connectivity (FC) by means of rsfMRI techniques is on-going challenge in the neuroimaging field. In the present investigation we compare two mathematical models for the computation of Resting-State Networks: The first one is based on the pure analysis of time courses (pure Functional Connectivity, pFC), the second one, the FD model, includes both the time courses, the anatomical information between brain nodes and topological metrics of the network which models the brain. The two approaches have been evaluated by comparing the maximal weights of the links representing the neural network obtained by applying the two models to a dataset of rsfMRI images from 133 healthy subjects. FC analyses were performed using the two methods by focusing on the functional connections between the anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus (PHGA), a core area for cognitive and emotive processes, and the rest of the brain. Based on the literature, we expect to collect evidences of the role of PHGA as connector hub between the temporal pole and the nodes of the Default Model Network. As expected, the majority of the significant links involved were highlighted by both methods. However, the FD model highlighted a greater number of links compared with pFC. These links are in line with the known neuroanatomy. Hence, our results invite to consider the FD approach as an effective approach of analysis, since due to its characteristics it could provide a more complete description of the brain network.</p>

																		<p>The topic of multiple personality, redefined as Dissociative Identity Disorders (DIDs) in the DSM-5, is an intriguing and still debated disorder with a long history and deep cultural and epistemological implications, extending up to the idea of possession.<br />
Hypnosis is an appealing and valuable model to manipulate subjective experience and get an insight on both the physiology and the pathophysiology of the mind-brain functioning; it and has been closely connected with DIDs and possession since its origin in 18th century and as recently proved the capacity to yield a loss of sense of agency, mimicking delusions of alien control and spirit possession.<br />
In this study we report on five very uncommon “hypnotic virtuosos” (HVs) free from any psychiatric disorder, spontaneously undergoing the emergence of multiple identities during neutral hypnosis; this allowed us to check the relationship between their experience and fMRI data.<br />
During hypnosis the subjects underwent spontaneous non-intrusive experiences of other selves which were not recalled after the end of the session, due to post-hypnotic amnesia. The fMRI showed a significant decrease of connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN) especially between the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex.<br />
Our results and their contrast with the available data on fMRI in DIDs allows to draw the hypothesis of a continuum between healthy mind – where multiple identities may coexist at unconscious level and may sometimes emerge to the consciousness – and DIDs, where multiple personalities emerge as dissociated, ostensibly autonomous components yielding impaired functioning, subject’s loss of control and suffering. If this is the case, it seems more reasonable to refrain from seeking for a clear-cut limit between normality (anyway a conventional, statistical concept) and pathology, and accept a grey area in between, where ostensibly odd but non-pathological experiences may occur (including so-called non-ordinary mental expressions) without calling for treatment but, rather, for being properly understood.</p>

																			<p>One of the main limitations of pharmacological fMRI is its inability to provide a molecular insight into the main effect of compounds, leaving an open question about the relationship between drug effects and haemodynamic response. The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on functional connectivity (FC) using a novel multimodal method (Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets - REACT). This approach enriches the resting state (rs-)fMRI analysis with the molecular information about the distribution density of serotonin receptors in the brain, given the serotonergic action of MDMA.<br />
																			Twenty healthy subjects participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A high-resolution in vivo atlas of four serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4) and its transporter (5-HTT) was used as a template in a two-step multivariate regression analysis to estimate the spatial maps reflecting the whole-brain connectivity behaviour related to each target under placebo and MDMA.<br />
																			Results showed that the networks exhibiting significant changes after MDMA administration are the ones informed by the 5-HTT and 5-HT1A distribution density maps, which are the main targets of this compound. Changes in the 5-HT1A-enriched functional maps were also associated with the pharmacokinetic levels of MDMA and MDMA-induced FC changes in the 5-HT2A-enriched maps correlated with the spiritual experience subscale of the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire.<br />
																			By enriching the rs-fMRI analysis with molecular data of voxel-wise distribution of the serotonin receptors across the brain, we showed that MDMA effects on FC can be understood through the distribution of its main targets. This result supports the ability of this method to characterise the specificity of the functional response of the brain to MDMA binding to serotonergic receptors, paving the way to the definition of a new fingerprint in the characterization of new compounds and potentially to a further understanding to the response to treatment.</p>
